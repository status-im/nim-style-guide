# Formatting

Projects are recommended to use [`nph`](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph) for formatting source code and to verify this is follwed [in CI](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph-action) using a pinned `nph` version.

## Tips

* Avoid changing the formatting of unrelated surrounding code
* Libraries and projects may not all use the same `nph` version - check that the formatter has not made a mess
